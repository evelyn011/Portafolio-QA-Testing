# Portafolio-QA-Testing

# About Me üëã
Hi, my name is Evelyn Altagracia de la Rosa Yan. I‚Äôm a Junior QA Tester who is passionate about software quality and testing. Since starting my career, I have been actively learning and developing my skills in manual and automated testing. I am excited about applying my knowledge in real-world projects and contributing to the development of high-quality software.

I hold certifications in AT_SQA, Platzi‚Äôs Software Testing Fundamentals, and specialized courses in API Testing and ERP Automation from Udemy. These experiences have given me a strong foundation in testing principles, test case creation, and defect identification.

Currently, my main focus is on furthering my knowledge in test automation as I believe it plays a crucial role in the future of QA. I am eager to take on new challenges and continue expanding my skills to become a more efficient and effective tester. In this portfolio, I would like to showcase the practical skills I have gained through courses, hands-on projects, and self-study.

# My Experience üè¢
As a Junior QA Tester, I am at the beginning of my career but have already gained foundational experience in both manual and automated testing. I have worked on projects where I created and executed test cases, identified defects, and ensured software met quality standards.

In addition, I have practical experience using tools like Jira for defect tracking and working in Agile environments to deliver high-quality software. I have also started exploring API testing and test automation, areas in which I am keen to continue growing.

Although I‚Äôm new to the professional world of QA, I am highly motivated to learn and develop as a software tester. I am excited to apply my skills and grow within a team, and I‚Äôm eager to contribute to the success of software projects by ensuring they meet the highest quality standards.
