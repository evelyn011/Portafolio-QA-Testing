# Portafolio-QA-Testing

# About Me 👋
Hi, my name is Evelyn de la Rosa. I am a QA Engineer and Software Engineer passionate about ensuring software quality and delivering reliable solutions. Since the beginning of my career, I have been developing my skills in both manual and automated testing, with practical experience designing and executing test strategies for web, mobile, and API applications. In my current role as a QA Analyst at MINERD, I work with Selenium, Postman, Jira, SQL, and GitLab to create and manage test cases, validate business logic, and integrate testing into CI/CD pipelines.

I hold certifications from AT*SQA, Platzi’s Software Testing Fundamentals, and specialized training in API Testing and ERP Automation from Udemy. These credentials, combined with my professional projects, have given me a solid foundation in testing principles, automation frameworks, defect identification, and reporting.

Currently, my focus is on strengthening my expertise in test automation, as I believe it is essential for the future of QA. I am eager to take on new challenges, grow professionally, and apply my skills to deliver efficient, scalable, and high-quality testing solutions. This portfolio highlights the practical abilities I have developed through professional experience, courses, and continuous self-learning.

# My Experience 🏢
As a Junior QA Tester, I am at the beginning of my career but have already gained foundational experience in both manual and automated testing. I have worked on projects where I created and executed test cases, identified defects, and ensured software met quality standards.

In addition, I have practical experience using tools like Jira for defect tracking and working in Agile environments to deliver high-quality software. I have also started exploring API testing and test automation, areas in which I am keen to continue growing.

Although I’m new to the professional world of QA, I am highly motivated to learn and develop as a software tester. I am excited to apply my skills and grow within a team, and I’m eager to contribute to the success of software projects by ensuring they meet the highest quality standards.
