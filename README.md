#About me#
I am a Junior QA Tester, currently at the start of my career in software quality assurance. I have completed certifications such as ISTQB, Platzi's Software Testing Fundamentals, and specialized courses in API Testing and ERP System Automation from Udemy. I am passionate about applying my knowledge in defect identification, creating test cases, and using agile methodologies to ensure the quality and functionality of software applications.

Although I'm early in my professional journey, I am eager to contribute to software projects, learn continuously, and grow in my role. Iâ€™m focused on improving my skills and becoming more efficient with testing tools to deliver high-quality results in every project I work on. With a strong commitment to learning and improving, I am excited to apply my growing expertise in real-world testing environments.
